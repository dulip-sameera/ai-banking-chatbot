# AI Banking Chatbot

This AI-powered chatbot simulates an intelligent banking assistant, capable of interacting with users through natural language. Built using Python, Tkinter, and SQLite, it can respond to various banking-related queries about account types, loans, branches, and services. It leverages NLTK for natural language processing and integrates with OpenAI's GPT API to enhance conversational capabilities with dynamic, context-aware responses. Ideal for demonstrating interactive AI in customer service scenarios.
